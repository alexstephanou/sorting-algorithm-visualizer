# sorting-algorithm-visualizer

This is a GUI I created to visualize sorting algorithms in real time, as they sort an array. This was done in Python using Tkinter to create a desktop interface. Algorithms include bubble sort, heap sort, insertion sort, radix sort, merge sort, quick sort and selection sort. To run this project, download all files and run only the 'Visualizer' file.
